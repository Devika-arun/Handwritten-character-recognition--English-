# Handwritten-character-recognition-English

**OBJECTIVE**

- A growing field of research in pattern recognition, computer vision, and artificial intelligence is handwritten character recognition. A system is supposed to acquire and recognise characters from paper documents, images, touch-screen devices, and other sources and convert them into machine-encoded form when performing handwriting recognition.

- This project focuses on Convolutional Neural Network that would reduce the processing time while providing higher recognition accuracy. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are playing an important role nowadays in every aspect of computer vision applications. Thus, Implementing CNN models to recognize the handwritten characters in English. While converting old documents into digital form, it also aims to improve the accuracy rate using CNN.

**ADVANTAGES OF DIGITIZING THE HANDWRITTEN CHARACTERS**

The following are some of the purposes: 
- An electronic version of a paper form can be created, making it simple to keep and mail.
- It is less expensive than hiring someone to manually enter a significant amount of text data.
- Furthermore, the conversion process to the electronic form is quicker.
